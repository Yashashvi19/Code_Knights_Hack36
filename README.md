## Introduction:
This pandemic has made it hard for students across the globe to connect with  their peers. Study Hub offers the perfect solution to it! It allows students to connect with their peers from different institutes and courses/specialization. They can connect for virtual group study sessions, doubt discussion, chatting and more. The idea originally aimed at also providing the facility for  searching for tutors(who register on our app) for various subjects and classes and then coming together for virtual tuition classes, as that too has become difficult in these tough times.
